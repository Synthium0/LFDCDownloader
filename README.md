# LFDCDownloader
A script that makes downloading packages from digitalcontent easier


## Getting Started
Ensure you have all the modules required for this project by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
`python main.py <TARGET_ID>`

Or, if you'd like to decompress the package immediately after it downloads (if it's an .lf3 package)

`python main.py <TARGET_ID> -d`
